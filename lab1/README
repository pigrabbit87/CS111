Limitation described in last paragraph
LIMITATION: getting Error 1 with make check

A token, consisting of a simple command, is retrieved from the shell script by
continously grabbing bytes from the shell script until a full simplee command is
formed. The token, stored in a allocated char pointer array, is then used to
create a single command structure. 

Three tokens form a subtree, with the middle token as an operator. The subtree
is then passed along so that the previously created subtree is the left subtree
of the current tree. Subtrees are created then attached to the tree until a
complete command is formed.

A complete command (a command stream), made of many simple commands stringed 
together by special tokens, is organized into a structure similar to a binary 
tree. The commands are read starting from the lowest left node of the tree. The 
tree is traversed in-order: left subtree, root, right subtree. 

The multiple command streams are inserted into a linked list which is later
traversed in the read function.

If there is illegal syntax in the shell script, the program outputs an error
message with the line number and aborts. 
LIMITATION:
Line number is occasionally not truee to shell script file. Sometimes the error
is located in the line above instead of the line printed.
